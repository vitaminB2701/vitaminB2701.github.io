I am a postdoctoral researcher at Nanyang Technological University Singapore, in the School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, under Professor Howe-Siang Tan.

My expertise is on ultrafast nonlinear optical spectroscopy, especially coherent two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). We apply the technique to study femtosecond-to-picosecond dynamical processes in physics, chemistry, and biology. 

My doctoral research has been about resolving excitonic energy transfer processes in the photosynthetic light-harvesting complex systems in plants.
