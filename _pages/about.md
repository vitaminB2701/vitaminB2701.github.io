I am a postdoctoral researcher at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, working in the [2DES@NTU](https://sites.google.com/view/howesiang/home/) group under Professor Howe-Siang Tan.

I specialize in ultrafast nonlinear optical spectroscopy, particularly coherent two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). The technique allows us to watch dynamical processes in physics, chemistry, and biology that happen on femtosecond-to-picosecond timescales (a femtosecond is a millionth of a billionth of a second).

I received my doctoral degree in 2024 through a dual-degree program between Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) and the University of Groningen (the Netherlands). My doctoral research focused on uncovering energy transfer processes in the light-harvesting systems that enable photosynthesis in plants.
