  abstract = {Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is used to theoretically and experimentally study a minimal three level ``V'' system (3LVS) with one ground state and two excited states coupled to common displaced harmonic oscillator modes. The third order non-linear optical response functions with frequency fluctuation correlation functions and frequency fluctuation cross correlation functions were derived using the displaced harmonic oscillator model to characterize the diagonal and cross-peaks. The two lowest vibronic transitions of a 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-pentacene (TIPS-Pn) molecule serve as a model system for the 3LVS considered above. TIPS-Pn's 2DES spectra were measured and analyzed using the center line slope (CLS) method. The CLSs of both the diagonal and cross-peaks consist of an exponential decay and an underdamped mode oscillating at a frequency of 264~cm-1, corresponding to the long axis breathing mode of the pentacene moiety of TIPS-Pn. The CLS oscillations' amplitude and phase of both the diagonal and cross-peaks were measured to have a specific relationship with each other, which is well predicted and simulated by our theory for the 3LVS of TIPS-Pn. We estimate an effective Huang--Rhys factor of {$\sim$}0.27, which quantifies the coupling of the two vibronic transitions to the long axis breathing mode of the pentacene moiety of TIPS-Pn. We show that such simultaneous CLS analysis recovering the amplitudes and phase relationships between diagonal peaks and cross-peaks measures the correlated vibrational coherences of different states. This can be used to quantify how different excited states or multi-chromophoric states are coupled to common modes in more complex multistate systems.},

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) is an integral part of the photosynthesis machinery, in which several light-harvesting complexes rely on inter-complex excitonic energy transfer (EET) processes to channel energy to the reaction center. In this paper, we report on a direct observation of the inter-complex EET in a minimal PSII supercomplex from plants, containing the trimeric light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), the monomeric light-harvesting complex CP26, and the monomeric PSII core complex. Using two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy, we measure an inter-complex EET timescale of 50 picoseconds for excitations from the LHCII-CP26 peripheral antenna to the PSII core. The 2D electronic spectra also reveal that the transfer timescale is nearly constant over the pump spectrum of 600 to 700 nanometers. Structure-based calculations reveal the contribution of each antenna complex to the measured inter-complex EET time. These results provide a step in elucidating the full inter-complex energy transfer network of the PSII machinery.},

  abstract = {We present the implementation of the time-domain multichromophoric fluorescence resonant energy transfer (TC-MCFRET) approach in the numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation (NISE) program. This method enables the efficient simulation of incoherent energy transfer between distinct segments within large and complex molecular systems, such as photosynthetic complexes. Our approach incorporates a segmentation protocol to divide these systems into manageable components and a modified thermal correction to ensure detailed balance. The implementation allows us to calculate the energy transfer rate in the NISE program systematically and easily. To validate our method, we applied it to a range of test cases, including parallel linear aggregates and biologically relevant systems like the B850 rings from LH2 and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. Our results show excellent agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of our TD-MCFRET method. We anticipate that this approach will be widely applicable to the calculation of energy transfer rates in other large molecular systems and will pave the way for future simulations of multidimensional electronic spectra.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has proven to be a highly effective technique in studying the properties of excited states and the process of excitation energy transfer in complex molecular assemblies, particularly in biological light-harvesting systems. However, the accurate simulation of 2DES for large systems still poses a challenge because of the heavy computational demands it entails. In an effort to overcome this limitation, we devised a coarse-grained 2DES method. This method encompasses the treatment of the entire system by dividing it into distinct weakly coupled segments, which are assumed to communicate predominantly through incoherent exciton transfer. We first demonstrate the efficiency of this method through simulation on a model dimer system, which demonstrates a marked improvement in calculation efficiency, with results that exhibit good concordance with reference spectra calculated with less approximate methods. Additionally, the application of this method to the light-harvesting antenna 2 (LH2) complex of purple bacteria showcases its advantages, accuracy, and limitations. Furthermore, simulating the anisotropy decay in LH2 induced by energy transfer and its comparison with experiments confirm that the method is capable of accurately describing dynamical processes in a biologically relevant system. This method presented lends itself to an extension that accounts for the effect of intrasegment relaxation processes on the 2DES spectra, which for computational efficiency are ignored in the implementation reported here. It is envisioned that the method will be employed in the future to accurately and efficiently calculate 2D spectra of more extensive systems, such as photosynthetic supercomplexes.},
